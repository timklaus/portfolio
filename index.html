              <p class="noitalics">If there is any recurring theme throughout my life; it is probably change. I have never been able to stay in one place long, stick to one hobby for long, or stick to a career path for long. It may seem to the observer that I may lack dedication or perserverance, but nothing could be further from the truth. My constant desire to change my pursuits is driven by the need to continue to grow and challenge myself. I have always been a relatively quick learner and have exploited that skill to its fullest extent.</p>
              <blockquote>I believe that in life, you really truly do not know what you cannot do until you try to do it and are stopped. I have yet to discover a single thing that I cannot do.  <span class="blockquotename">-Tim Klaus</span></Blockquote>
